# Sound Scheduler

This project contains a Flutter-based desktop application for scheduling and playing sounds with calendar support. The app provides:

- Calendar view of scheduled songs
- Template management for quick day setup
- Remote control over HTTP (volume and template adjustments)
- Simple in-app log of played sounds

The code is a basic skeleton intended for further development. It requires the Flutter SDK with Windows desktop support enabled to run.
